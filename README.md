# Laravel InvFest x ISF 9.0 Registration Web

This project is a registration portal that allows user to register and submit their project and administrators can manage web application from various aspects of the application, also checking user registration data including proof of payment and make sure all user data is valid.

## Overview

### Team Dashboard

- User can see their dashboard including team member, institution, and much more
- Submit their submission easily only with some step on submission form
- Current team status: User can see their payment status whatever it types

### Admin Dashboard

- The heart of the system, where authorized users can log in and access powerful tools.
- Admins can modify application setting, such as the title, description, and other essential information.
- Content management: Admins can update the web timeline content, ensuring it stays fresh and relevant.

### Security and Permissions

- Role-based access control (RBAC): Different admin roles (admin, petugas, team, etc.) with varying permissions.
- Authentication and authorization: Ensuring only authorized users can access the dashboard.
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Checking all content is safe to go, and prevent any xss injection for better security.

## Notes

- Composer installation Error

If you met installation error with message `need github token` or `permissions are sufficient for this personal access token`,
then you need to generate your github personal access token on `https://github.com/settings/tokens`, and make sure to checklist
`read:packages` permission, and generate token, and paste on token input after type your github username, token example

~~~bash
ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
-------------------------------
github_pat_xxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
~~~

- Pre Setup Error

To solve this error you need to run pre setup command.
copy command below and paste it on your terminal.

~~~bash
php artisan naka:pre-setup
~~~

- Lack of Performance

If your website seems laggy, or time to load content is slow as hell.
run this command and dont forget to clear all cache before.

~~~bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan optimize
~~~

or you could do simply with this command

~~~bash
php artisan naka:re-cache
~~~

- Storage symlink failed

When you deploy this on cpanel or similar, you need to change index.php base path,
after that, you can change storage link path on `config/filesystems.php`, scroll to bottom of config,
and change path, for example

~~~php
'links' => [
    public_path('../../public_html/storage') => storage_path('app/public'),
],
~~~

- Migration Error (SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes)

This happen when laravel default charset is different from database charset, i met this error before because of database server using `InnoDB`,
which mean it use latin1 charset, and max of string only 125 or 191 character, to fix this change your migration engine on `config/database.php`, scroll into connections list, and change your drive engine and set into `InnoDB`, for example

~~~php
'engine' => 'InnoDB',
~~~

- Notification won't sent to user

Keep in mind that default system using queue for jobs, that's mean when user register they need to wait until jobs is clear,
but if your system don't setup any cron job or using InnoDB (they can't load jobs database), so you need to disable on notification class,
just remove `implements ShouldQueue` from current class so it will be like this,

~~~php
class TeamRejected extends Notification
~~~

and if you want to activated notification jobs then change again to

~~~php
class TeamRejected extends Notification implements ShouldQueue
~~~

- Sitemap Endpoint

On production maybe you need to generate sitemap again due different domain,
but don't worry about this, just run command below it will generate sitemap
automatic using current endpoint (as long as you set APP_URL on .env)

~~~bash
php artisan make:sitemap
~~~

- Public Assets

If you adding some assets from external for example adding icons from iconscout,
or something, make sure you add it on local public assets, it will boost your
load time on production and development, as long as you used the optimized one.

And if you considering server bandwitdh or had to change system structure,
change it using CDN system or using external hosting provider. I don't recommend
this way, because security things. just keep it local as long as you can.

- Database Query

When you updating this backend or reworking this project, i personal highly
recommend you to do not query all fields, just select field(s) that only
you need, you must considering this as important thing, first of all it
will takes server resources, second when you using inertia or api based,
you will exposed all fields on public, even for the unused fields.
just select for the fields that you needed.

- Database Backup

Sometimes on development or production server mysql dumper may not be provided
due lack of resource, for this issue, contact server owner to enable mysql dumper
although you don't need this feature so much, but trust me better enable this
feature instead of backuping your client data manually.

## Security Things

- Content Security Policy (CSP)

For any reasons please don't turn on this feature, because we are implementing danger rendering on blade,
so for security issue, keep enable this feature, if you met any error such as script blocked or something,
read article about how to setting up CSP, so you can handle this error

- User Session

When this web deployed, please change session setting on `config/session.php`, keep in mind out main goal
is to secure user data, so follow this config for better session security,

~~~php
'encrypt' => env('SESSION_ENCRYPT', true)
'secure' => env('SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE', true),
~~~

- Secure Header

After all feature implemented, you can change secure heade config for better security,
so set HTTP Strict Transport Security config (force into https protocol), so it will be like this

~~~php
'hsts' => [
    'enable' => true,

    'max-age' => 31536000,

    'include-sub-domains' => false,

    'preload' => true,
],
~~~

## ToDo For Next Year

- Improvised some UI/UX

I think it's better change for landing page and other design, instead changing backend structure.
Otherwise you may change the 'backend' structure to following your current 'rule' of competition.

- Upgrade dashboard admin feature

May this helping you out when checking user data and other else, for more spesific data. for example,
you had to search data for user that don't had any member(s), for current feature thats filter doesn't
exists, so you may create it one. good luck

- Forgot Password

For some case, user may forget their password, instead of changing password through databases, i suggesting
you to adding forgot password feature, due to set minimum of dev work, trust me its better to make it one

- Configuring User Data

On admin dashboard, there is user menu, you can add action button for change manually about
user data, just in case if user dont know how to change their `forgotten` password, cheers.

- Resend OTP

when user registering their account, user had to verify their email address, this is crucial feature.
For better user experience, better to add resend otp code on their email address. And for rare case,
i mean just in case any trouble on user page. you may add resend action on admin dashboard, on OTP menu.
